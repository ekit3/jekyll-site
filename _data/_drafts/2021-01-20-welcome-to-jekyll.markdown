You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory.<br>
Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, <br>
but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.<br>
excerpt_separator:<br>
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.<br>

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
